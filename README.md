# I have only implemeted osmem.c

I don't own any of the other files or directories (e.g. tests directory or the grade.sh file).

# How to run it?

You need to fork it on a UNIX based operating system and to run the script type ./tests/grade.sh.
It will show 90 / 100 (10 points are awarded for coding style, but it needs a docker file which is removed from the repository).

# About the homework

I've spent more than 20 hours on this homework. It is not a very difficult one, but the hardest part was the malloc implementation because it needs to know how to free an allocated space without any other variable.
